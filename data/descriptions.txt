Sir John Kerr demonstration, 23rd June 1976
The Law Institute of Victoria hosted a dinner for John Kerr on the 23rd June 1976 at the Leonda Restaurant in Hawthorn. Due to the enormous publicity given to the first protest, this time the crowd was at least twice the size. There were enough people to successfully block entry to the restaurant, and the police had to finally batter a way through with mounted police for Kerr's car to proceed.

May Day march, 1st May 1977
John Ellis took these pictures as the march was leaving the Trades Hall to march down Russell Street. As the march approached the City Watch-house John Ellis saw a man taking photographs of the marchers from above the entrance to the watch-house. He was wearing a track suit similar to those off-duty police entering the watch-house below. Since that incident John has photographed many security police, Special Branch and Commonwealth, and still believes that their motives are political and have nothing to do with any breaches of the peace.

CICD workshop, Torquay ; John Lloyd, Penny Pollitt
Guest speaker at the Congress for International Co-operation and Disarmament(CICD) workshop weekend at Jack O'Mara's house in Torquay was Penny Pollitt (nee Ralph), daughter-in-law of Harry Pollitt, secretary of the CP in the UK. She was en route to England after being released from detention in Santiago, Chile. While she spoke at length about the coup, she found it too difficult to talk about her detention in the stadium where so many were tortured. This is John Lloyd and Penny Pollitt. 
Stop Omega Campaign rally in Yarram, 14th August 1977
Stop Omega Campaign held a rally in Yarram (Darriman Shire) to alert the local population to the danger of hosting a nuclear target in their locality. John Ellis writes: "This was the site finally chosen for the base. We had been successful in preventing the building of Omega in Australia for approximately 10 years. The US Navy tried unsuccessfully to build the base in New Zealand as this was the preferred geographical site needed for its worldwide navigation system. The Royal Society of New Zealand final report rejected Omega pointing out the possibility of a retaliatory nuclear strike at the base was real and the benefits to the country were minimal. The Americans then tried various sites in Australia only to find that there was strong opposition to Omega here also. Tasmania was preferred because of its southern position but opposition prevented its erection. It was also rejected in Queensland. Victoria was next on the list. At each selected site we mounted opposition groups, took car cavalcades to the towns and presented speakers from the anti-war movement and universities. Subsequently, we lost the battle but we didn't retreat without a fight. The company who won the contract, E. A. Watts, built a small wind test station to monitor wind velocity on the site (see neg. 137). A few of us decided that we might delay things a little longer if we "interrupted" the monitoring. So one Friday night we left Melbourne with the boot of a car stuffed with all sorts of implements to give Omega the final bash. I had been to the site previously to locate the test station and map roads out of the area in case we were sprung. On the night we arrived it was pitch black -- good for such an operation but bloody hard to find the station in the middle of a huge paddock. The plan was for three of us to cut the guy wires holding the aerial and destroy the instruments inside the building while the driver of our car waited some kilometres from the site. Having spent some time locating the building we were about to start cutting the wires when we heard a police carsiren screaming up the highway. We were sure we had been sprung, but it kept going. However, that could also mean that they were after our getaway car and driver. In any case we went to work on the site and put our bolt cutters to good use -- the aerial came crashing down and we smashed the instruments and took the data sheets. (I used the same bolt cutters in December, 1995 to cut the fence surrounding the construction site for the Grand Prix circuit at Albert Park. As I was the only bolt-cutter arrested out of many, I became known as the freelance bolt-cutter.) We made our way back to the road thinking all the time that our car had been picked up and we would be stranded. However, at the appointed time our friend appeared; he too heard and saw the police car coming and was preparing to abandon ship, but it kept on going to Sale. We thought that the test site might be monitored so we drove straight away to Paynesville. Just in case we were picked up we had fishing gear in the boot as an alibi. Our trip home on Sunday was uneventful and we were quite pleased with our efforts. We eagerly bought the morning newspapers and expected to read front-page news of our "terrorist" activities. Alas, we only made a two-inch single- column item buried inside the paper and what made it worse was that the damage was attributed to vandals! Perhaps we should have left our calling card. POSTSCRIPT: Frontline, Nov.-Dec. 1993: The establishment of an Omega navigation aid in Australia was the centre of great controversy in the late 1970s, so it came as a surprise recently when the Australian Government announced that Omega in Gippsland would close in February next year unless the United States provided funding to keep it open. Less than a week later, the US Government faxed a strong response to the Australian Government suggesting in the strongest possible terms that the station remain open. The Omega station in Gippsland is one of eight similar stations in Argentina, Japan, Liberia, Norway, France, Hawaii and the USA, which constitute an accurate world-side navigation information network. The anti-war movement argued that Omega had a special feature -- very low frequency transmitters able to penetrate seawater to a considerable depth -- that would allow (sic.) communication [read navigation] for nuclear submarines such as Trident while they remained completely submerged, and that this connected Australia to the U.S. nuclear submarine war strategy.

We thought that the test site might be monitored so we drove straight away to Paynesville. Just in case we were picked up we had fishing gear in the boot as an alibi. Our trip home on Sunday was uneventful and we were quite pleased with our efforts. We eagerly bought the morning newspapers and expected to read front-page news of our "terrorist" activities. Alas, we only made a two-inch single- column item buried inside the paper and what made it worse was that the damage was attributed to vandals! Perhaps we should have left our calling card. POSTSCRIPT: Frontline, Nov.-Dec. 1993: The establishment of an Omega navigation aid in Australia was the centre of great controversy in the late 1970s, so it came as a surprise recently when the Australian Government announced that Omega in Gippsland would close in February next year unless the United States provided funding to keep it open. Less than a week later, the US Government faxed a strong response to the Australian Government suggesting in the strongest possible terms that the station remain open. The Omega station in Gippsland is one of eight similar stations in Argentina, Japan, Liberia, Norway, France, Hawaii and the USA, which constitute an accurate world-side navigation information network. The anti-war movement argued that Omega had a special feature -- very low frequency transmitters able to penetrate seawater to a considerable depth -- that would allow (sic.) communication [read navigation] for nuclear submarines such as Trident while they remained completely submerged, and that this connected Australia to the U.S. nuclear submarine war strategy.

Ken Matthews at Sir John Kerr demonstration, 23rd June 1976
The Law Institute of Victoria hosted a dinner for John Kerr on the 23rd June 1976 at the Leonda Restaurant in Hawthorn. Due to the enormous publicity given to the first protest, this time the crowd was at least twice the size. There were enough people to successfully block entry to the restaurant, and the police had to finally batter a way through with mounted police for Kerr's car to proceed. The abuse handed out by the protesters wasn't only for Kerr, but also for the lawyers and their partners who supported the event. Ken Matthews holds a banner reading The law is schizophrenic - it is both an ASS and a KERR!

USS "Queenfish" was the first nuclear-attack submarine to visit an Australian port. The police created a situation that led to a violent attack on demonstrators. Despite repeated appeals by John Ellis and others to senior police to stop the violence there were injuries and many arrests (see neg. 149 for a more detailed description). Les Dalton and John Speight painted a radioactive symbol on the roadway. Senior police said this action was damaging Ports and Harbor property and tried to arrest Les and John.

Pat Jessen and Elly Fricker at the Honeymoon uranium mine rally, May 1982.
Honeymoon uranium mine rally, May 1982. John Ellis describes the background to the rally: On October 27, 1981 the Federal Government approved the mining of uranium at a site 75 km north-west of Broken Hill. Called the Honeymoon Uranium Project, it is a joint venture between MINAD, wholly owned by CSR, Carpentaria Exploration Co., 48% overseas owned and TETON Co., 100% owned by UNC Resources Inc., a U.S.-based uranium mining company. Current Australian ownership is 63%. Present Commonwealth policy calls for 75% Australian ownership of all uranium projects. Approval has, however, been granted to mine at Honeymoon. "The process for mining uranium at Honeymoon involves pumping an acid solution into the ground, allowing it to dissolve the uranium and sucking it out through an extraction well. The full-scale operation would consume per year: 12,000 tonnes of sulphuric acid, etc." (from The Honeymoon Handbook). The photo shows Pat Jessen and Elly Fricker at the rally.

Honeymoon uranium mine rally, May 1982.
Honeymoon uranium mine rally, May 1982. John Ellis describes the background to the rally: "On October 27, 1981 the Federal Government approved the mining of uranium at a site 75 km north-west of Broken Hill. "The process for mining uranium at Honeymoon involves pumping an acid solution into the ground, allowing it to dissolve the uranium and sucking it out through an extraction well. The full-scale operation would consume per year: 12,000 tonnes of sulphuric acid, etc." (from The Honeymoon Handbook). The photo shows the van used by Ian Cohen and Benny Zable, Rainforest Action Group. They travelled from Queensland to be at this occupation.

Unemployed Workers' Union soup kitchen outside the Arts Centre, 12 December 1978.
Unemployed Workers' Union soup kitchen outside the Arts Centre, 12 December 1978. Ellis stated "This demonstration was held to protest the hypocrisy of the Victorian Government (Thompson or Hamer) in concluding a three-day conference on the plight of the poor by hosting a banquet at the Art Gallery for conference delegates. The conference, titled "Work for Tomorrow", was attended by ALP, trade union, church groups and other aid organisations. The Unemployed Workers' Union was outraged by this display of opulence and abundance so they decided to set up a soup kitchen outside the Gallery entrance in an effort to shame those attending the banquet (fat chance). Our theme was "Work for Today". Needless to say, there was a huge police presence outside the front entrance to provide a clear passage for the diners (we had other names for them) as they entered. I was particularly enraged by the indifference of the delegates and was determined that we shouldn't let them get away with it. I decided that we had to do something so I went looking for other entry points to the Gallery and found one in Nolan Street. There were no police present on the gate so I went up some stairs and found myself in the kitchen where the banquet was being prepared. Having got the lay of the land I nonchalantly left the kitchen and had to restrain myself from running back to the others with the good news of my discovery. My plan was for a few of us to get to the banquet hall and pull the tablecloths and everything else off the tables. Without alerting the police I spoke to about ten people and told them of the plan (Harry Van Moorst and Di Crunden were among them). We left the main demonstration in two's and met at the entrance in Nolan Street; once assembled we went like hell up the stairs and entered the kitchen. As we were leaving the kitchen along a hallway to the banquet room we were "sprung" by the manager who raised the alarm. What followed would make a good movie scene. We might still have made the room had it not been for the fact that one of the bouncers picked up one of the young women and threw her at a refrigerator. We were more intent then on getting him and by that time the coppers had arrived. Seven of us were taken to South Melbourne police station and charged with "being on the premises without a lawful excuse". The court case came up in March 1979 (the news cutting on p10 makes no reference as to why we were charged). The four of us who appeared in the witness box and argued that there were no police guarding the entrance, had our charges dismissed. The other three, who refused to go into the box because their priors would have been read out and may have received a heavier fine, were fined $150 each. The fines were never collected."

Australian Broadcasting Commission Dance Band - Brian May (conductor), 5th April 1981. This was the final concert given by the ABC Dance Band in the Myer Music Bowl before it was disbanded due to lack of funding.

Joan Baez visit - Jan. 1974
Joan Baez being interviewed at Tullamarine Airport.She was invited to speak and perform at an anti-Vietnam war concert in the Myer Music Bowl. At the airport interview one tabloid photographer told her that his editor wouldn't accept a photo of her unless she had a guitar in her hands. She told him rather heatedly that she had come to Australia more as an anti-war activist than as a singer; she refused to be photographed with her guitar.

Vietnamese medical team visits Australia.
A Vietnamese medical team visited Australia to discuss the effects of Agent Orange. John Ellis describes the background to the visit: "Thousands of tons of this herbicide, manufactured by Dow Chemical, were dropped on Vietnam during the war. It was an attempt to defoliate the vegetation, thus leaving the Vietnamese exposed to the invading U.S. and Australian troops. This act of barbarity left a legacy of deformed babies and many incurable diseases for the Vietnamese people as well as U.S. and Australian troops. A meeting was held in Clyde Holding's electoral office in Ackland Street."

Honeymoon uranium mine rally, May 1982 - 'Land Rights' banner.
Honeymoon uranium mine rally, May 1982. John Ellis describes the background to the rally: On October 27, 1981 the Federal Government approved the mining of uranium at a site 75 km north-west of Broken Hill. Called the Honeymoon Uranium Project, it is a joint venture between MINAD, wholly owned by CSR, Carpentaria Exploration Co., 48% overseas owned and TETON Co., 100% owned by UNC Resources Inc., a U.S.-based uranium mining company. Current Australian ownership is 63%. Present Commonwealth policy calls for 75% Australian ownership of all uranium projects. Approval has, however, been granted to mine at Honeymoon. "The process for mining uranium at Honeymoon involves pumping an acid solution into the ground, allowing it to dissolve the uranium and sucking it out through an extraction well. The full-scale operation would consume per year: 12,000 tonnes of sulphuric acid, etc." (from The Honeymoon Handbook). the photo shows a 'Land Rights' banner at the march through Broken Hill.

Quilapayun concert in Dallas Brookes Hall, Melbourne.
Quilapayun concert in Dallas Brookes Hall. Quilapayun (which means 'seven beards' in the language of the Chilean Indians) was Chile's most famous folk song group, which was formed in July 1965. Working with Victor Jara, Chile's finest folksinger and songwriter, they led a growing New Chilean Song movement, moving from songs reflecting a newly awakened national identity to songs that were part of a political process, the growing opposition to the politics of reaction and exploitation, and they became great supporters of the coalition government of President Allende, the Unidad Popular. Immediately following the coup of September 11, 1973, in which the government of President Allende was overthrown, Victor Jara was imprisoned in the Santiago boxing stadium; his hands were broken, and he was machine-gunned to death. Joan Jara (centre), his widow, toured with the group and spoke of her life with Victor; she also performed.

John Ellis writes "Pro-war groups attempt to stop the march at Flinders Street. I was taking pics from above Princes Bridge Station when I found one of the pro-war supporters' microphones. There was so much confusion and congestion that I refused to give it back and was able to tell the marchers what I thought these pro-war people were about. They eventually pulled the plug on me!"

Banjo Clarke
Banjo Clarke. John Ellis describes his meeting with Banjo Clarke and his brother, Ray: "I met "Banjo" Clarke while visiting my sick mother in Warrnambool Base Hospital; he was recuperating after a bout of illness. I questioned him about Koorie life in Warrnambool and after a lengthy discussion in which he told me he had just finished appearing in a popular TV series, he invited me to visit the family's property at Framlingham. Banjo had great delight in introducing me to a very old woman, Mary Maude Clarke, whom he claimed was the great granddaughter of Truganini; she was blind and had skin that was almost white. Len Clarke was somewhere on the property but I was unable to photograph him. Since that time he has become an administrator in Aboriginal affairs."

Honeymoon uranium mine rally, May 1982 - 'Campaign Against Nuclear Energy' banner.
Honeymoon uranium mine rally, May 1982. John Ellis describes the background to the rally: On October 27, 1981 the Federal Government approved the mining of uranium at a site 75 km north-west of Broken Hill. Called the Honeymoon Uranium Project, it is a joint venture between MINAD, wholly owned by CSR, Carpentaria Exploration Co., 48% overseas owned and TETON Co., 100% owned by UNC Resources Inc., a U.S.-based uranium mining company. Current Australian ownership is 63%. Present Commonwealth policy calls for 75% Australian ownership of all uranium projects. Approval has, however, been granted to mine at Honeymoon. "The process for mining uranium at Honeymoon involves pumping an acid solution into the ground, allowing it to dissolve the uranium and sucking it out through an extraction well. The full-scale operation would consume per year: 12,000 tonnes of sulphuric acid, etc." (from The Honeymoon Handbook). The photo shows the 'Campaign Against Nuclear Energy' banner.

Congress for International Co-operation and Disarmament reception for World Peace Council representatives - Romesh Chandra, Secretary-General WPC. Delegation of six WPC Councillors visited Australia in October 1974. They came as guests of the Australian Committee of World Peace Councillors, co-sponsored by Pax Christi, Trade Union Peace and Solidarity Committee and the Australian Union of Students. A public meeting was held in the Assembly Hall and a reception at the John Curtin Hotel. Dr. Joe Camilleri (lecturer in politics, LaTrobe University, now professor, 1994), Terry Lane (ABC) and Dave Davies ("Tribune" reporter) conducted the meeting. 
The Reverend James Lawson at the Congress for International Co-operation and Disarmament (CICD) Hiroshima Day meeting.
The Reverend James Lawson at the Congress for International Co-operation and Disarmament Hiroshima Day meeting. John Ellis describes Reverend Lawson and his role in the civil rights and peace movements: The Rev. James Lawson (Civil Rights activist, U.S.) would be one of the most dynamic and believable speakers that I have ever heard (tape in my collection). Quote from publicity for the rally: "Our guest speaker for the occasion will be Rev. James Lawson -- an outstanding black American Methodist minister and long-time civil rights and anti-war campaigner. Rev. Lawson comes from Los Angeles and is currently Chairman of the Christian Leadership Conference - the ongoing organisation of Martin Luther King. He is also Convenor of the Rose Bowl Disarmament Committee working on a large rally for this month. Reverend Lawson has been jailed on a number of occasions for civil disobedience acts during the Korean and Vietnam wars and civil rights marches." The meeting was held at the Palais Theatre, St. Kilda. 
Australian International Defence and Equipment Exhibition (AIDEX) protest, Canberra, 26-28th November 1991.
Australian International Defence and Equipment Exhibition (AIDEX) protest, Canberra, 26 November 1991. Australia's largest-ever arms sales exhibition was held at the National Exhibition Centre in Canberra. It was a showcase for overseas defence manufacturers wishing to sell in our region and, as such, attracted many peace, environmental and radical left activists. John Ellis writes "The rally was most successful in bringing the attention of the public to this hideous industry. Unfortunately the police and security forces used excessive force. In fact it seemed to herald in a new era by government to use the Tactical Response Group (TRG) in intimidating and also using force on demonstrators. Gerry Harant and I complained of police brutality to the Federal Ombudsman and were eventually interviewed by Federal Internal Investigation police. The taped interview is in my collection with relevant correspondence. There were many other complaints to the Ombudsman and ours eventually fizzled out with no satisfaction. In many cases police were completely unidentifiable and uniformed police removed their ID numbers. I included photographs of police violence on protesters in my complaint but they were dismissed."

Reverend Sato (Japanese Buddhist monk) from Japan at a Congress for International Co-operation and Disarmament meeting.
Rev. Sato (a Japanese Buddhist monk) and a professor, both from one of the Japanese peace movements, came to Australia on a speaking tour. During the war Sato was a major in the Japanese Imperial Army; his family history had a military background. When he saw the devastation at Hiroshima and Nagasaki he renounced his army career and became a Buddhist monk. He also became politically active. When the Japanese Government decided to extend a civilian runway at Nareda (?) Airport to take military aircraft, he became involved in the protest. He built and lived in a hut at the end of the runway, preventing the use of the runway for some time.

Hiroshima Day march from Frankston to Melbourne, 1975 - Sam Goldbloom (left) and Jim Cairns (right) at the City Square. The march started Saturday morning and stopped overnight in Moorabbin where a concert was held. It resumed Sunday morning and stopped for lunch at a church near St. Kilda Junction; the march continued along St. Kilda Road to a mass lie-in in the City Square. This was one of the first big marches after the Vietnam war and showed the growing strength of the anti-uranium movement. 
Launch of Les Dalton's book 'Radiation Exposures', 20 May 1991.
Launch of Les Dalton's book "Radiation Exposures", 20 May 1991. "Les Dalton was born in 1919 in Sydney. He started work in 1933 in a small family business that had pioneered the manufacture of plastics in Australia early in the century. He qualified in industrial chemistry at the old Sydney Technical College in 1939, and in 1941 joined the CSIRO in Melbourne to work on plastics used in warplanes. Later his research interests turned to organic synthesis for cancer drugs and plant chemicals. In 1976 Dalton retired early, as a principal research scientist at CSIRO's division of organic chemistry, to pursue his interests in environmental issues. He has made submissions to public and parliamentary inquiries on the health problems of power lines, and on the mining of uranium and mineral sands. Les Dalton is the author of The Nuclear Environment (1983). He and his wife Dorothy live in Melbourne. They have two sons and two grandchildren."

Michael David (defence) and Greg James (prosecution) at the war crimes trial of Ivan Ivanechko (Polyukhovich), March 1992. John Ellis describes the background to the taking of the photograph: "By chance I was in Adelaide when the committal hearings for the first Australian War Crimes trial began (Second World War). The charges were brought against Ivan Timofeyevich Polyukhovich (also known as Ivanechko) for crimes alleged to have happened in the town of Serniki, in the Ukraine. As a child living through the war and later watching the emergence of fascist-type elements in Australia, I have always retained an interest in the Holocaust and its aftermath (after all, my mother was Jewish, Freda Olga Cohen). In later years I also befriended people who suffered at the hands of the Ustashi in Australia and I felt that somehow I too was part of that nightmarish period. I was inextricably drawn to witness this event. The accused was finally acquitted of all charges. David Bevan, an ABC journalist who covered the trial, wrote an excellent book, A Case to Answer about the trial. Among newspaper cuttings in this album is a letter I wrote and had published in The Age. There is also an abusive and threatening letter I received after publication of the letter.

Herald Delivery vans, assisted by police, at the Printing and Kindred Industries Union (PKIU) strike.
Printing and Kindred Industries Union (PKIU) strike. John Ellis describes the strike and his role in it: This strike was the result of a breakdown in negotiations between the Printing and Kindred Industries Union (PKIU) and the Newspaper Proprietors' Association (NPA). The Age workers were also on strike. The issue at the centre of the dispute was computerisation of typesetting and make-up in the composing room and whether non-union labour (staff) could operate the equipment. Even though John had been employed at Herald Gravure Printers for 16-17 years he maintained that because he was a typesetter/comp his allegiance was with the chapel members at Flinders St. After all, any gains that the Herald chapel made would flow on to him. Herald Gravure Printers management didn't agree with his view naturally, but he was adamant and went on a one-man strike. The strike lasted almost two weeks and in that time he spent many hours (day and night) on the picket line. He slept at the Dalton's in Canning St. on a few occasions as it was convenient to be on the picket line at short notice. Staff from all the Herald and Weekly Times Ltd's subsidiaries were expected to work their equipment and drive delivery trucks, etc., to get the paper out. The Herald and Weekly Times Ltd and Fairfax (The Age) also brought in trained female typists from Sydney to work the typesetting equipment. As well as this, they also had to contend with a huge police presence which ensured that the trucks went out. Negotiators won some concessions but by and large they lost control of a large amount of typesetting work to non-union labor.

Our negotiators won some concessions but by and large we lost control of a large amount of typesetting work to non-union labor. When I returned to work at Herald Gravure Printers the manager, Jack Dempsey, called me to his office. Tony Duggan was with him and they went through the whole episode of my role on the picket line. I was told me that head office (Flinders St) wanted me sacked because of my radical behaviour. I agreed with most of what he said regarding the taking of pics of senior management of the Herald and Weekly Times Ltd, (Sir Philip Jones, who came down to observe the picket, was particularly upset); I was trying to get a shot of him with some of the "toads" from the comp room (see pic. 31). I remained silent until he finished speaking then asked him what he was going to do. I told him he could do one of two things: he could sack me, which would embroil him in a strike at Herald Gravure Printers or he could let things simmer down and hope that the problem would go away. I was pretty confident that I had them over a barrel as I was in the middle of some very large jobs and that the Herald and Weekly Times Ltd annual report was due any day. Although the management resented my politics (to say the least) they relied on my integrity and skill to do many of their most confidential jobs, e.g., prospectus, submissions, balance sheets, etc. I left his office and never heard another word about the episode. Waiting on the result of negotiations (pictured).
