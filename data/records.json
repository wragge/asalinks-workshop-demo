The US Navy tried unsuccessfully to build the base in New Zealand as this was the preferred geographical site needed for its worldwide navigation system. The Royal Society of New Zealand final report rejected Omega pointing out the possibility of a retaliatory nuclear strike at the base was real and the benefits to the country were minimal. The Americans then tried various sites in Australia only to find that there was strong opposition to Omega here also. Tasmania was preferred because of its southern position but opposition prevented its erection. It was also rejected in Queensland. Victoria was next on the list. At each selected site we mounted opposition groups, took car cavalcades to the towns and presented speakers from the anti-war movement and universities. Subsequently, we lost the battle but we didn't retreat without a fight. The company who won the contract, E. A. Watts, built a small wind test station to monitor wind velocity on the site (see neg. 137). A few of us decided that we might delay things a little longer if we \"interrupted\" the monitoring. So one Friday night we left Melbourne with the boot of a car stuffed with all sorts of implements to give Omega the final bash. I had been to the site previously to locate the test station and map roads out of the area in case we were sprung. On the night we arrived it was pitch black -- good for such an operation but bloody hard to find the station in the middle of a huge paddock. The plan was for three of us to cut the guy wires holding the aerial and destroy the instruments inside the building while the driver of our car waited some kilometres from the site. Having spent some time locating the building we were about to start cutting the wires when we heard a police carsiren screaming up the highway. We were sure we had been sprung, but it kept going. However, that could also mean that they were after our getaway car and driver. In any case we went to work on the site and put our bolt cutters to good use -- the aerial came crashing down and we smashed the instruments and took the data sheets. (I used the same bolt cutters in December, 1995 to cut the fence surrounding the construction site for the Grand Prix circuit at Albert Park. As I was the only bolt-cutter arrested out of many, I became known as the freelance bolt-cutter.) We made our way back to the road thinking all the time that our car had been picked up and we would be stranded. However, at the appointed time our friend appeared; he too heard and saw the police car coming and was preparing to abandon ship, but it kept on going to Sale. We thought that the test site might be monitored so we drove straight away to Paynesville. Just in case we were picked up we had fishing gear in the boot as an alibi. Our trip home on Sunday was uneventful and we were quite pleased with our efforts. We eagerly bought the morning newspapers and expected to read front-page news of our \"terrorist\" activities. Alas, we only made a two-inch single- column item buried inside the paper and what made it worse was that the damage was attributed to vandals! Perhaps we should have left our calling card. POSTSCRIPT: Frontline, Nov.-Dec. 1993: The establishment of an Omega navigation aid in Australia was the centre of great controversy in the late 1970s, so it came as a surprise recently when the Australian Government announced that Omega in Gippsland would close in February next year unless the United States provided funding to keep it open. Less than a week later, the US Government faxed a strong response to the Australian Government suggesting in the strongest possible terms that the station remain open. The Omega station in Gippsland is one of eight similar stations in Argentina, Japan, Liberia, Norway, France, Hawaii and the USA, which constitute an accurate world-side navigation information network. The anti-war movement argued that Omega had a special feature -- very low frequency transmitters able to penetrate seawater to a considerable depth -- that would allow (sic.) communication [read navigation] for nuclear submarines such as Trident while they remained completely submerged, and that this connected Australia to the U.S. nuclear submarine war strategy.

However, that could also mean that they were after our getaway car and driver. In any case we went to work on the site and put our bolt cutters to good use -- the aerial came crashing down and we smashed the instruments and took the data sheets. (I used the same bolt cutters in December, 1995 to cut the fence surrounding the construction site for the Grand Prix circuit at Albert Park. As I was the only bolt-cutter arrested out of many, I became known as the freelance bolt-cutter.) We made our way back to the road thinking all the time that our car had been picked up and we would be stranded. However, at the appointed time our friend appeared; he too heard and saw the police car coming and was preparing to abandon ship, but it kept on going to Sale. We thought that the test site might be monitored so we drove straight away to Paynesville. Just in case we were picked up we had fishing gear in the boot as an alibi. Our trip home on Sunday was uneventful and we were quite pleased with our efforts. We eagerly bought the morning newspapers and expected to read front-page news of our \"terrorist\" activities. Alas, we only made a two-inch single- column item buried inside the paper and what made it worse was that the damage was attributed to vandals! Perhaps we should have left our calling card. POSTSCRIPT: Frontline, Nov.-Dec. 1993: The establishment of an Omega navigation aid in Australia was the centre of great controversy in the late 1970s, so it came as a surprise recently when the Australian Government announced that Omega in Gippsland would close in February next year unless the United States provided funding to keep it open. Less than a week later, the US Government faxed a strong response to the Australian Government suggesting in the strongest possible terms that the station remain open. The Omega station in Gippsland is one of eight similar stations in Argentina, Japan, Liberia, Norway, France, Hawaii and the USA, which constitute an accurate world-side navigation information network. The anti-war movement argued that Omega had a special feature -- very low frequency transmitters able to penetrate seawater to a considerable depth -- that would allow (sic.) communication [read navigation] for nuclear submarines such as Trident while they remained completely submerged, and that this connected Australia to the U.S. nuclear submarine war strategy.

John Ellis describes the background to the rally: On October 27, 1981 the Federal Government approved the mining of uranium at a site 75 km north-west of Broken Hill. Called the Honeymoon Uranium Project, it is a joint venture between MINAD, wholly owned by CSR, Carpentaria Exploration Co., 48% overseas owned and TETON Co., 100% owned by UNC Resources Inc., a U.S.-based uranium mining company. Current Australian ownership is 63%. Present Commonwealth policy calls for 75% Australian ownership of all uranium projects. Approval has, however, been granted to mine at Honeymoon. \"The process for mining uranium at Honeymoon involves pumping an acid solution into the ground, allowing it to dissolve the uranium and sucking it out through an extraction well. The full-scale operation would consume per year: 12,000 tonnes of sulphuric acid, etc.\" (from The Honeymoon Handbook). The photo shows Pat Jessen and Elly Fricker at the rally.

The conference, titled \"Work for Tomorrow\", was attended by ALP, trade union, church groups and other aid organisations. The Unemployed Workers' Union was outraged by this display of opulence and abundance so they decided to set up a soup kitchen outside the Gallery entrance in an effort to shame those attending the banquet (fat chance). Our theme was \"Work for Today\". Needless to say, there was a huge police presence outside the front entrance to provide a clear passage for the diners (we had other names for them) as they entered.

The charges were brought against Ivan Timofeyevich Polyukhovich (also known as Ivanechko) for crimes alleged to have happened in the town of Serniki, in the Ukraine. As a child living through the war and later watching the emergence of fascist-type elements in Australia, I have always retained an interest in the Holocaust and its aftermath (after all, my mother was Jewish, Freda Olga Cohen). In later years I also befriended people who suffered at the hands of the Ustashi in Australia and I felt that somehow I too was part of that nightmarish period. I was inextricably drawn to witness this event. The accused was finally acquitted of all charges. David Bevan, an ABC journalist who covered the trial, wrote an excellent book, A Case to Answer about the trial. Among newspaper cuttings in this album is a letter I wrote and had published in The Age. There is also an abusive and threatening letter I received after publication of the letter.

John Ellis describes the background to the taking of the photograph: \"By chance I was in Adelaide when the committal hearings for the first Australian War Crimes trial began (Second World War). The charges were brought against Ivan Timofeyevich Polyukhovich (also known as Ivanechko) for crimes alleged to have happened in the town of Serniki, in the Ukraine. As a child living through the war and later watching the emergence of fascist-type elements in Australia, I have always retained an interest in the Holocaust and its aftermath (after all, my mother was Jewish, Freda Olga Cohen). In later years I also befriended people who suffered at the hands of the Ustashi in Australia and I felt that somehow I too was part of that nightmarish period. I was inextricably drawn to witness this event. The accused was finally acquitted of all charges. David Bevan, an ABC journalist who covered the trial, wrote an excellent book, A Case to Answer about the trial. Among newspaper cuttings in this album is a letter I wrote and had published in The Age. There is also an abusive and threatening letter I received after publication of the letter.\" NOTE: To see the remainder of this description, please contact the University of Melbourne Archives.

When I returned to work at Herald Gravure Printers the manager, Jack Dempsey, called me to his office. Tony Duggan was with him and they went through the whole episode of my role on the picket line. I was told me that head office (Flinders St) wanted me sacked because of my radical behaviour. I agreed with most of what he said regarding the taking of pics of senior management of the Herald and Weekly Times Ltd, (Sir Philip Jones, who came down to observe the picket, was particularly upset); I was trying to get a shot of him with some of the \"toads\" from the comp room (see pic. 31). I remained silent until he finished speaking then asked him what he was going to do. I told him he could do one of two things: he could sack me, which would embroil him in a strike at Herald Gravure Printers or he could let things simmer down and hope that the problem would go away. I was pretty confident that I had them over a barrel as I was in the middle of some very large jobs and that the Herald and Weekly Times Ltd annual report was due any day. Although the management resented my politics (to say the least) they relied on my integrity and skill to do many of their most confidential jobs, e.g., prospectus, submissions, balance sheets, etc. I left his office and never heard another word about the episode.
