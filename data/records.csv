206003085,227009277,"Stop Omega Campaign rally in Yarram, 14th August 1977","Ellis, John","Stop Omega Campaign held a rally in Yarram (Darriman Shire) to alert the local population to the danger of hosting a nuclear target in their locality. John Ellis writes: ""This was the site finally chosen for the base. We had been successful in preventing the building of Omega in Australia for approximately 10 years. The US Navy tried unsuccessfully to build the base in New Zealand as this was the preferred geographical site needed for its worldwide navigation system. The Royal Society of New Zealand final report rejected Omega pointing out the possibility of a retaliatory nuclear strike at the base was real and the benefits to the country were minimal. The Americans then tried various sites in Australia only to find that there was strong opposition to Omega here also. Tasmania was preferred because of its southern position but opposition prevented its erection. It was also rejected in Queensland. Victoria was next on the list. At each selected site we mounted opposition groups, took car cavalcades to the towns and presented speakers from the anti-war movement and universities. Subsequently, we lost the battle but we didn't retreat without a fight. The company who won the contract, E. A. Watts, built a small wind test station to monitor wind velocity on the site (see neg. 137). A few of us decided that we might delay things a little longer if we ""interrupted"" the monitoring. So one Friday night we left Melbourne with the boot of a car stuffed with all sorts of implements to give Omega the final bash. I had been to the site previously to locate the test station and map roads out of the area in case we were sprung. On the night we arrived it was pitch black -- good for such an operation but bloody hard to find the station in the middle of a huge paddock.

John Ellis describes the background to the rally: On October 27, 1981 the Federal Government approved the mining of uranium at a site 75 km north-west of Broken Hill. Called the Honeymoon Uranium Project, it is a joint venture between MINAD, wholly owned by CSR, Carpentaria Exploration Co., 48% overseas owned and TETON Co., 100% owned by UNC Resources Inc., a U.S.-based uranium mining company. Current Australian ownership is 63%. Present Commonwealth policy calls for 75% Australian ownership of all uranium projects. Approval has, however, been granted to mine at Honeymoon. ""The process for mining uranium at Honeymoon involves pumping an acid solution into the ground, allowing it to dissolve the uranium and sucking it out through an extraction well. The full-scale operation would consume per year: 12,000 tonnes of sulphuric acid, etc."" (from The Honeymoon Handbook). The photo shows Pat Jessen and Elly Fricker at the rally.

Ellis stated ""This demonstration was held to protest the hypocrisy of the Victorian Government (Thompson or Hamer) in concluding a three-day conference on the plight of the poor by hosting a banquet at the Art Gallery for conference delegates. The conference, titled ""Work for Tomorrow"", was attended by ALP, trade union, church groups and other aid organisations. The Unemployed Workers' Union was outraged by this display of opulence and abundance so they decided to set up a soup kitchen outside the Gallery entrance in an effort to shame those attending the banquet (fat chance). Our theme was ""Work for Today"". Needless to say, there was a huge police presence outside the front entrance to provide a clear passage for the diners (we had other names for them) as they entered. I was particularly enraged by the indifference of the delegates and was determined that we shouldn't let them get away with it. I decided that we had to do something so I went looking for other entry points to the Gallery and found one in Nolan Street. There were no police present on the gate so I went up some stairs and found myself in the kitchen where the banquet was being prepared. Having got the lay of the land I nonchalantly left the kitchen and had to restrain myself from running back to the others with the good news of my discovery. My plan was for a few of us to get to the banquet hall and pull the tablecloths and everything else off the tables. Without alerting the police I spoke to about ten people and told them of the plan (Harry Van Moorst and Di Crunden were among them). We left the main demonstration in two's and met at the entrance in Nolan Street; once assembled we went like hell up the stairs and entered the kitchen. As we were leaving the kitchen along a hallway to the banquet room we were ""sprung"" by the manager who raised the alarm. What followed would make a good movie scene. We might still have made the room had it not been for the fact that one of the bouncers picked up one of the young women and threw her at a refrigerator. We were more intent then on getting him and by that time the coppers had arrived. Seven of us were taken to South Melbourne police station and charged with ""being on the premises without a lawful excuse"". The court case came up in March 1979 (the news cutting on p10 makes no reference as to why we were charged). The four of us who appeared in the witness box and argued that there were no police guarding the entrance, had our charges dismissed.

When I returned to work at Herald Gravure Printers the manager, Jack Dempsey, called me to his office. Tony Duggan was with him and they went through the whole episode of my role on the picket line. I was told me that head office (Flinders St) wanted me sacked because of my radical behaviour. I agreed with most of what he said regarding the taking of pics of senior management of the Herald and Weekly Times Ltd, (Sir Philip Jones, who came down to observe the picket, was particularly upset); I was trying to get a shot of him with some of the ""toads"" from the comp room (see pic. 31). I remained silent until he finished speaking then asked him what he was going to do. I told him he could do one of two things: he could sack me, which would embroil him in a strike at Herald Gravure Printers or he could let things simmer down and hope that the problem would go away. I was pretty confident that I had them over a barrel as I was in the middle of some very large jobs and that the Herald and Weekly Times Ltd annual report was due any day. Although the management resented my politics (to say the least) they relied on my integrity and skill to do many of their most confidential jobs, e.g., prospectus, submissions, balance sheets, etc. I left his office and never heard another word about the episode.
